### Prod Deployment

These instructions are for the deployment of the Node.js backend. 

- Verify the **version #** in package.json and package.lock.json.
    >

- **git push** any additional changes if needed from thedevelopment branch, pull and merge.
    >

- Update the **GitHub release** (should already exist).
This draft release was added right after the last release was published.
    >

- Redeploy **Heroku** from Main branch using the Heroku web console.
  >

- **Local Repo**: git fetch, git pull.
    >Only if needed.

- Create a new **GitHub release** as a draft for the next release.

    > Do this so that as features and bugs are fixed they can be added during development. Otherwise things might be forgotten during the developmnet cycle between releases.
